# React Live Weather App

This is a simple React Live Weather App using an api to fetch
the weather data.
I also implemented some weather visualizations that change if the weather is either hot or cold.



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm so you need to installed on your system.
npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. Download Node.js.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raz2222/react-live-weather-app.git
